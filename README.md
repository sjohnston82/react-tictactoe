Made as a guided tutorial from Arash Ahadzadeh's Complete React Bootcamp 2020 (w/ React Hooks, Firebase) on SkillShare.

This was a fun project and the first time I've gotten my feet wet with react and nodejs.  It was a great learning experience where I learned how to set up new projects, what state is and how to use and destructure it and how to use many components to make a SPA.

Languages:  JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS
